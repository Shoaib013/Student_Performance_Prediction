**Project Overview**
This project focuses on developing a model which predicts the performance of the student in the upcoming exams.
**Data Source**
The data is taken from Kaggle.
**Methods Used**
. Machine Learning
. Data Analysis
. Linear Regression
**Technologies**
.Python
.Jupyter
**Packages Used**
.Pandas
.Numpy
.Matplotlib
**Steps Followed**
1. Downloaded the data from Kaggle and did analysis on the dataset.
2. Extracted Features that would be useful for good model.
3. Written the Linear Regression from scratch. Three functions are used which are compute cost,compute gradient and gradient descent.
4. The compute cost function computes the cost.
5. The compute gradient function updates the weights and bias values.It tries to find the best weights and loss.
